Background: Around June 10th, EAC released an update that significantly strengthened DLL signature verification. The old days where simply applying a Take2 signature was enough for injection are long gone.

Progress: After several days of research, I’ve successfully achieved DLL injection into the game. I’m sharing the injection demo here—feel free to reach out if you're interested in technical discussion or collaboration.

Note: My GitHub account had been suspended for quite a while, but it’s finally back to normal as of today.


背景：EAC 在 6 月 10 日左右的一次更新后，加强了对 DLL 签名的校验，以前那种打上 Take2 的签名就能注入的时代已经一去不复返了。

进展：经过几天时间的研究，我现在已经可以成功对游戏进行注入。特别分享一下注入过程和效果，有兴趣的朋友欢迎交流探讨。

补充：我的 GitHub 账号挂起了很长一段时间，今天终于可以正常使用了。
